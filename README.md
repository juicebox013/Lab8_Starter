Graceful degradation and service workers are related in the sense that they work in a similar fashion. As a refresher, graceful degradation is when you begin with complicated and max technology and slowly degrade down with grace to address the lower levels. In the same way, service workers are utilized as a fallback or safety net for a max level website when it no longer has connection to the network. This is because service workers fetch the information that we call from the internet and stores it in a local storage to use again instead of going back to the internet.
